Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork: clone repository from other github user. I would use fork when i want to edit the file without making any changes on original file of original user.
Clone: clone repostory from GitHub to local. It is only workable on local, you don't have permission to editor it on github except forking.
Branches: All ppl can edit the file by using branch function. It basically clone a file and open another extension for working on the file. 
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The benefit is that you can have a back up file for making comparision.
